		The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. 
		Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.
		Given the secret number secret and your friend's guess guess, print the hint for your friend's guess.
