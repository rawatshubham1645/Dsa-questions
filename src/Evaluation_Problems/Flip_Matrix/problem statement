		Flip Matrix 


Description
-------------------------

Given an n x n binary matrix, flip the matrix horizontally, then invert it, and print the resulting matrix.

To flip the matrix horizontally means that each row of the matrix is reversed.

For example, flipping [1,1,0] horizontally results in [0,1,1].

To invert the matrix means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0.

For example, inverting [0,1,1] results in [1,0,0].


Input
Input Format

First-line contains integer n representing the number of rows and columns of the binary matrix arr.

Following n lines contains n-integers.

Constraints

1 <= n <= 100

0 <= arr[i][j] <= 1


Output
Print the required matrix, n lines containing n elements.


Sample Input 1 

3 
1 1 0
1 0 1
0 0 0 
Sample Output 1

1 0 0
0 1 0
1 1 1


Hint

See we will firstly flip each row of the matrix,

So the resultant matrix is

0 1 1
1 0 1
0 0 0

Now we will invert each row.

Resultant matrix will be,

1 0 0
0 1 0
1 1 1
